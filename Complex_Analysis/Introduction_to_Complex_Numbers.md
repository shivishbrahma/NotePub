## Definition of C

A complex number C is a number in the form $a + i b$ where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers.

$a$ is called the real part, and $b$ is called the imaginary part.

If $a=0$, then C is a imaginary number. If $b=0$, then C is a real number.

C also can be represented on a 2D Cartesian plane, as ($a, b$) coordinate.

## Algebra of Complex Number

- $(a + i b) + (c + i d) = (a + c) + i (b + d)$
- $(a + i b)(c + i d) = (ac - bd) + i (ad + bc)$
- Proof $\frac{(a + i b)}{(c + i d)}$ is a complex number, provided that $c + i d \neq 0$.
